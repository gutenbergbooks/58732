<h2><a name="PREFATORY_NOTE" id="PREFATORY_NOTE"></a>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p>In “Windmills and Wooden Shoes” we have a continuous
story of the doings of the Dutch children, Jan
and Katrina and their little friends.</p>

<p>Teach the children to read this book so that the personalities
of the children depicted therein will become vividly
lifelike to the little readers. Encourage them to bring
to class pictures of Dutch life and of Holland scenery.</p>

<p>Make the children in the book live for the children in
the class. Let them close their eyes and see in imagination
the big windmill, the canals with the drooping willow
trees, the slow-moving barge, and the shadows in the
water. Picture the busy market place, and the Dutch
children at work and at play. Teach the children the
words and music of the little song found on page 6. Both
the words and music have been arranged to give the
rhythmic sound of the wooden shoes as the little Dutch
wearers “klip klop” about in their work and play.</p>

<p>The lessons in the book may be illustrated by the children
with drawings and paper cuttings,&mdash;the Dutch
house, the windmill, the Dutch children, the flowers in
the garden, the stork, the geese, the dog and the milk-cart,
the boats, the wooden shoes, and many other things
that will suggest themselves from the text to the ingenious
teacher.</p>

<h3>HOLLAND</h3>
</div>


<p>Far over the sea is a country called
Holland. It is not a large country.</p>

<p>The Dutch people live in Holland.
They have made dikes to keep the sea
from their land.</p>

<p>Do you know what dikes are?</p>

<p>They are huge walls made of stone.
They are very large and strong. If a
dike should break, the country would
be flooded.</p>

<p>There are many canals in Holland.
Some of the canals are so large and
deep that big ocean steamships can sail
on them.</p>

<p>There are many boats on the canals.
People live on the boats all the year
round.</p>

<h3>THE DUTCH PEOPLE</h3>
</div>


<p>The Dutch people are very clean and
neat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>Indeed, Holland is said to be the
cleanest country in the world.</p>

<p>The Dutch mothers scrub their
houses both inside and outside. They
scrub the bricks on the sidewalks. If
there is a tree near by, they scrub the
trunk of that.</p>

<p>Oh, they are very, very clean. You
would find no dust in their houses.
Their houses are always clean and
shining.</p>

<h3>THE WINDMILLS</h3>
</div>


<p>There are many,
many windmills in
Holland.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="i_012.jpg" width="176" height="250" />
</div>

<p>They whirl and
whirl all day long.</p>

<p>When the long
arms of the windmills
whirl, they make
a creaking sound.</p>

<p>The windmills are
busy workers.</p>

<p>They work for the people of Holland.</p>

<p>You think that is strange, do you
not? Perhaps you are wondering what
work a windmill can do as it whirls
and whirls in the wind?</p>

<p>I will tell you.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>The windmills pump water. The
windmills grind corn and other grain.
The windmills saw wood, too. The
Dutch people could not do without
their big windmills.</p>

</div>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_014.jpg" alt="i_014.jpg" width="101" height="200" />
</div>

<p>Jan and Katrina are Dutch children.
They live in a little blue house.</p>

<p>Their house is near a big, brown
windmill.</p>

<p>The roof of their
house is made of red
tile.</p>

<p>Near the chimney
is a big stork’s nest.</p>

<p>It is made of sticks
and straw.</p>

<p>Jan and Katrina
like to watch the
storks.</p>

<p>They are glad when
the little storks peep out of the nest.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE WOODEN SHOES</h3>
</div>


<p>Jan and Katrina wear wooden shoes.
When they walk, the shoes go “Klip,
klop, klip, klop.”</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_015.jpg" alt="i_015.jpg" width="178" height="250" />
</div>

<p>I think it would be
hard to walk in wooden
shoes.</p>

<p>Do you not think so?</p>

<p>Katrina and Jan do
not think so.</p>

<p>They can run and
jump and walk in their
wooden shoes.</p>

<p>They keep them very clean and
white. They scrub them every night
before they go to bed. Then they are
all nice and clean to put on in the
morning.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p>You might think that a wooden shoe
is heavy. It is not heavier than your
own shoe.</p>

<p>It is smooth inside. It is as smooth
as your own little shoe.</p>

<p>It is held on the foot by a leather
strap. Some wooden shoes are painted
and have patterns on them. Others
are scrubbed as white as snow.</p>

<h3>THE DUTCH FATHER</h3>
</div>


<p>Katrina and Jan get up very early in
the morning. Their father and mother
get up early too.</p>

<p>Their father goes out in his fishing
boat. He is gone all day. At sunset,
he comes home.</p>

<p>Katrina and Jan run to meet him.
Sometimes they run on the high dike.
They tell their father all that has happened
during the day.</p>

<p>They are very happy together.</p>

<h3>THE DUTCH MOTHER</h3>
</div>


<p>Katrina’s mother has some cows.
They are black and white. The Dutch
mother gets up early in the morning to
milk the cows.</p>

<p>She puts the milk into shining pans.
Then she waits for the cream to rise.
She takes the cream and from it she
makes butter and cheese.</p>

<p>Katrina helps her mother. She
churns the butter. Sometimes she puts
the cheeses on the shelves.</p>

<p>Katrina’s mother makes brown bread
and white bread. Katrina likes the
brown bread, but Jan likes the white
bread best. He likes to eat it with
butter and honey.</p>

<h3>THE BLUE DISHES</h3>
</div>


<p>Katrina’s mother has some pretty
dishes. They are blue and white
dishes.</p>

<p>Katrina has a little plate. Jan has a
plate, too. They use their plates at
breakfast, dinner, and supper.</p>

<p>Katrina likes to wash her mother’s
blue and white dishes. She dries them
with a little towel. When she dries
them, she puts them away in the cupboard.
She is very careful. She puts
them neatly on the shelves in the cupboard.</p>

<h3>JAN’S WORK</h3>
</div>


<p>Jan’s mother wants Jan and Katrina
to be busy children. She does not
want them to play all the time.</p>

<p>So Jan drives the black and white
cows to the green meadow. At night
he goes after them. He tends the
geese, too. They have great flocks of
geese.</p>

<p>Katrina helps Jan watch the geese in
the meadow. They are big, white
geese. They look like patches of snow
on the green meadow.</p>

<h3>KATRINA’S WORK</h3>
</div>


<p>Katrina’s mother is
very kind to her.</p>

<p>She gave her some
knitting needles one
day. She gave her a
big ball of red yarn.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_024.jpg" alt="i_024.jpg" width="255" height="450" />
</div>

<p>She showed Katrina
how to knit.</p>

<p>Katrina learned
very fast.</p>

<p>Soon she could
knit as well as her mother.</p>

<p>Her mother showed her how to knit
stockings, mittens, lace, and even a
hood. Katrina is very proud of her
knitting work.</p>

<h3>KATRINA’S DUCKS</h3>

<p>Katrina has some ducks of her own.
They are big, white ducks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>She is fond of her big, white ducks.
She takes them to the little pond in
the meadow. They like to swim in the
pond.</p>

<p>Katrina takes her knitting with her.
She knits while the ducks swim.</p>

<p>The ducks say “Quack, quack,” as
they swim about. Katrina sings a little
song while she knits. She sings:</p>

<h3>KATRINA’S BAKING</h3>
</div>


<p>“Will you make me some rolls,
Katrina?” asked Jan one day. “Bram
and I are going out in the meadow.
Mother said we could stay until it is
time to bring the cows home.”</p>

<p>“But I have no meal,” said Katrina.</p>

<p>“I will go over to Mynheer Van’s
windmill. I will bring you some meal,”
said Jan. So Jan ran to the windmill
and brought home the meal.</p>

<p>Katrina made him some rolls. She
made him a cake too. She put little
seeds in the cake. It was very good.</p>

<p>Then she got a pat of butter and a
slice of cheese. She put the rolls, cake,
butter, and cheese in a basket. She
spread a clean napkin over the top.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>“Here is your lunch, Jan,” she called.
“There is enough for Bram, too.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="i_028.jpg" width="195" height="300" />

<p>“You are a good little sister, Katrina.
Thank you very much,” said Jan. Then
he and Bram went away to the meadow
to stay until sunset.</p>

<h3>KATRINA’S MOTHER</h3>
</div>


<p>The Dutch mother is busy all day.
She looks very neat at her work. She
wears a blue dress. She wears a stiff
white cap. She wears a big brown
apron.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>Sometimes when it is cool, she wears
a pretty red shawl. She has some
gold ear-rings.</p>

<p>Katrina says she is going to wear
gold ear-rings when she grows up. She
thinks her mother’s ear-rings are very
pretty.</p>

<p>Katrina’s mother wears wooden
shoes, too, but her shoes are much
larger than Jan’s or Katrina’s.</p>

<p>Jan’s mother made him a little coat.
She made it of blue cloth. She put big
brass buttons on it.</p>

<p>Jan likes to count his buttons. He
plays a game with them. He makes a
wish; and pointing to his buttons, he says,
“Yes, no, yes, no.” He pretends the
buttons tell him if he will get his wish.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>Jan is proud of
his fine blue coat.</p>

<p>He wears it
when he goes to
town.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_031.jpg" alt="i_031.jpg" width="316" height="500" />
</div>

<p>The mother
made Katrina
a little stiff
cap and a
pretty white
apron. The
apron had
lace on it.
Katrina’s mother knit the lace.</p>

<h3>JAN’S DOG, RINK</h3>
</div>

<p>Jan has a dog. He is a good strong
dog. His name is Rink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>Jan has a big cart. It is a milk cart.
It is always full of tall, shining milk-cans.</p>

<p>Rink draws the cart. He draws it to
the town. Jan drives him.</p>

<p>When they go to the town, Jan sells
his good sweet milk. Jan is kind to
Rink. He helps him pull the cart
when the way is rough. He pats Rink
on the head and says, “Good Rink,
good Rink. You are a good dog. I
will give you a big bone when I get
home.”</p>

<p>And Jan always does what he says.
He always gives Rink a bone, and a
drink of fresh water, when he comes
back from the town.</p>

<h3>THE LITTLE DUTCH FRIENDS</h3>
</div>


<p>Hilda, Kassie, and Karl are little
Dutch children, too. They do not live
far from the blue house where Jan and
Katrina live.</p>

<p>They live over on the other side of
the big, brown windmill. They come
to play with Jan and Katrina. Katrina
and Jan go over to play with them.</p>

<p>Hilda, Kassie, and Karl live in a
red house. It is by the canal.</p>

<p>The children like to play there.
They have a little flatboat. They sail
around on the canal. Sometimes they
sail under the little bridge by the
meadow.</p>




<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<h3>SELLING THE MILK</h3>
</div>


<p>“O mother,” said Katrina one day,
“there goes Jan to town with the milk
cart! May I go with him and Rink?
Please let me go, mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Katrina,” said mother, “you
may go, but you must take your knitting
with you. You can knit as you walk
along with Jan beside the milk cart,
and when the milk is sold, you may
ride home in the cart.”</p>

<p>So Katrina ran for her knitting, and
soon she was walking along by the
side of Jan and Rink.</p>

<p>Her ball of yarn was in the big pocket
of her apron, and she knit busily as she
walked. She was careful not to drop
any stitches.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p>When they came to the town,
Katrina helped Jan sell the milk. Soon
all the milk was sold and the big cans
were empty.</p>

<p>“Get in the cart, Katrina,” said Jan,
“and have a ride home.” “No,” said
Katrina, “it is such a warm day, and
poor Rink is tired. Just think! He
pulled all these heavy milk cans to
town!”</p>

<h3>HILDA’S VISIT</h3>
</div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_038.jpg" alt="i_038.jpg" width="267" height="400" />
</div>

<p>Hilda came over to the blue house
one day. Jan’s mother was busy. She
was washing her pretty blue dishes.
She was all alone.</p>

<p>“Where is Jan?” asked Hilda.</p>

<p>“Jan has gone to town
with Rink and the cart,”
said Mother.</p>

<p>“Where is Katrina?”</p>

<p>“Katrina has gone
over to the windmill
to get
water,” said
Mother.</p>

<p>“She will be
home soon.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p>“Come in, Hilda.”</p>

<p>So Hilda went in and sat down in
Jan’s little red chair. “Katrina said
she would come and play with me. I
will wait for her,” said Hilda.</p>

<p>“Where are you going to play?”
asked Mother.</p>

<p>“We are going to play by the canal,”
said Hilda, “and Karl says he will take
us to ride in the boat.”</p>

<p>“There is Katrina now,” said Mother.
“See! she has two pails of water. How
careful she is! She does not spill a drop!”</p>

<p>Katrina was very glad to see Hilda.
She set her pails of water on the broad
shelf in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Here is the fresh water, Mother,”
she cried;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> “now you can have a nice
cool drink.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_040.jpg" alt="i_040.jpg" width="238" height="400" />

canal.</p>

<h3>THE DUTCH BEDS</h3>
</div>


<p>The Dutch beds are not like our beds.
They are built in the walls of houses
like cupboards. They are like little
shelves or presses in the wall.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p>They have feather beds on them.
The feather beds are nice and soft.</p>

<p>In summer, the Dutch boys and girls
have quilts over them. In the winter,
they sleep on one feather bed, and have
another feather bed and quilts to cover
them. They are very warm.</p>

<p>Katrina has a blue and white quilt on
her bed. Jan has a red and green
quilt. Their grandmother made the
quilts for them.</p>

<p>Their grandmother is a dear little
Dutch lady who lives down near the
ocean. The children like to go and see
her.</p>

<h3>THE DUTCH GRANDMOTHER’S HOUSE</h3>
</div>


<p>Jan’s grandmother lives in a little
pink and white house by the sea. You
can hear the waves as they come up
on the sandy shore.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>You can stand in grandmother’s garden
and look away out over the sea.</p>

<p>Sometimes the water looks bright
and blue. Sometimes it looks deep
and green. Sometimes it looks dark
gray, and the waves have white caps
of foam. The children call them the
“Sea-King’s White Horses.”</p>

<p>Grandmother’s house is very neat
and clean. She has brick floors in her
house. She covers her brick floors
with clean white sand.</p>

<p>Grandmother has a very old black
table in her house. She has some old
black chairs, too. She rubs them every
day. They are always bright and shining.</p>

<p>Grandmother loves to keep them so.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>Jan says he can see his face in the
top of grandmother’s table. It is so
shiny that it is like a looking-glass.</p>

<p>Grandmother has a row of plates on
her wall. They look like silver.</p>

<p>She has some blue dishes, too. Katrina
says that they are like her
mother’s dishes. They have boats and
windmills on them.</p>

<p>Grandmother says they are Delft
dishes. They were made in Delft.
Delft is a city in Holland where they
make beautiful dishes.</p>

</div>

<p>Jan’s grandmother has
a clock. It is a beautiful
clock. It is made
of carved wood. It is
made in the shape of a
little house.</p>

<p>There is a door in the
house and there are
windows.</p>

<p>The weights that hang
down look like big
acorns.</p>

<p>The numbers on the
face of the clock are
white.</p>

<p>The hands are white,
too.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>When it is time for the clock to
strike, a little bell rings. The little
door flies open. Out pops a dear little
white bird. It is a cuckoo. It says
“Cuckoo, cuckoo!”</p>

<p>If it is three o’clock, it says “Cuckoo”
three times. If it is six o’clock, it says
“Cuckoo” six times.</p>

<p>What hour does it say “Cuckoo”
the most times? What name do we
call that hour in the day-time? When
does it say “Cuckoo” only once?</p>

<p>Grandmother winds the cuckoo clock
once a week. She winds it every
Sunday morning. She winds it just
before she goes to church.</p>

<h3>GRANDMOTHER’S DUTCH STOVE</h3>
</div>


<p>Grandmother has a large stove. It
is not at all like our stoves. Our
stoves are made of iron and are black.</p>

<p>Grandmother’s Dutch stove is white.
It is made of white porcelain. There
are pretty colored pictures on grandmother’s
stove.</p>

<p>Jan and Katrina like to go to grandmother’s
on a cold day and sit before
her pretty stove. They take off their
wooden shoes and get their toes warm.</p>

<p>Grandmother sits beside the stove,
too. She tells them pretty stories about
the pictures on her stove.</p>

<h3>VISITING AT GRANDMOTHER’S</h3>
</div>


<p>Grandmother asked Jan and Katrina
to come and visit her one day. She
told them to bring their friends, Hilda,
Kassie, Karl, and Bram with them.</p>

<p>Hilda, Kassie, Karl, and Bram were
all glad to go. So they dressed in
their best.</p>

<p>“We will meet by the windmill,”
they said, “and we will go along the
dike to grandmother’s house.” So they
met at the windmill, and away they
went all together.</p>

<p>Grandmother was looking for them.
She took them into the house. She
gave them each a bowl of curds and
whey and some nice, fresh honey cakes.</p>

<p>“Oh, how good this is!” cried Kassie.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Grandmother, no one can
make curds and whey like yours,” said
Jan.</p>

<p>“Or honey cakes either,” said Karl.</p>

<p>When the children went home, grandmother
gave each one of them a honey
cake cut like a heart. She gave each
one a pretty shell.</p>

<p>The children said, “We have had
such a good time, grandmother.”</p>

<p>And grandmother said, “I have had
a good time, too, children. You must
come to see me again soon.”</p>

They take Rink and the cart up on the
dike too.</p>

<p>Rink likes to run on the dike. He
likes to feel the fresh air blow in from
the sea.</p>

<p>When they are up on the dike, Jan
and Katrina can see all around. They
can see far, far away. They can look
out over the broad ocean. They see
the big boats and the little boats sailing
to and fro.</p>

<p>Jan points to the ocean and says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
“Katrina, away, away over the ocean,
where those big boats are sailing, is
America. American boys and girls live
there. It is a
fine country
and very
large.”</p>

<p>“Do you
think we will
ever go to
America, Jan?”
asks little Katrina.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,
some day,” answers
Jan.</p>

<p>When Jan
and Katrina
are up on the
dike, they can
look over their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>own land. They can see the canals and
the bridges and the boats.</p>

<p>They can see the beautiful gardens.
They can see the bright houses, and
the big windmills that whirl round and
round.</p>

<p>They can see the girls tending geese
in the fields. They can see the black
and white cows eating grass in the
meadows. They can see the men with
their dog-carts going along the road to
town.</p>

<h3>JAN’S BIRTHDAY</h3>
</div>


<p>It is Jan’s birthday. He is eight
years old. He is a very happy little
boy.</p>

<p>He has many fine birthday presents.</p>

<p>Father gave him a beautiful little toy
boat. It has sails on it and it can go
very fast.</p>

<p>Mother gave him a book. In it is a
story of a boy named Peter. Jan will
tell you about it when he reads his
book.</p>

<p>Katrina gave Jan a red cap that she
knit herself, and Grandmother gave
him a beautiful little green and yellow
bird in a cage.</p>

<p>Jan says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> “Everybody is so good to
me on my birthday.”</p>

<p>O, Jan was very happy!</p>

<p>And then in the afternoon, mother
asked Hilda and Bram and Karl and
Kassie to come over. She set the table
out in the garden.</p>

<p>In the middle of the table was a big
pink birthday cake. It had nuts on
the top of it. It was very good. The
children all said so. And they knew,
for they ate it all!</p>

<h3>THE DUTCH GARDENS</h3>
</div>


<p>No one can think of a more beautiful
sight than the Dutch gardens in spring.
They are full of red, yellow, white and
pink tulips.</p>

<p>There are rows and rows of purple,
pink and white hyacinths.</p>

<p>There are great fields of yellow
daffodils. They look like patches of
sunshine.</p>

<p>There are rows and rows of beautiful
white narcissus plants. The sweetness
of these plants fills the air.</p>

<p>Katrina and Jan love to go into
the beautiful gardens. They pull the
weeds from the flower beds.</p>

<p>They like to watch the big, buzzing
bees fly around among the flowers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>They like to see the pretty butterflies
flitting here and there. Some of the
butterflies are white and red, and some
are big and yellow.</p>

<p>“The white and red butterflies look
like tulips flying away,” said Jan.</p>

<p>“The yellow butterflies look like
daffodils,” said little Katrina.</p>

<h3>THE BARGE</h3>
</div>


<p>Bram’s father has a barge. Do you
know what a barge is?</p>

<p>It is a big flat boat. The barge of
Bram’s father is red and yellow.</p>

<p>It has big blue sails. It looks very
pretty as it sails down the canals.
Bram’s father often takes him out in
the barge.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_065.jpg" alt="i_065.jpg" width="39" height="200" />
</div>

<p>Sometimes Bram asks Jan and
Katrina, Hilda, Kassie, and Karl to go
with him.</p>

<p>When the flowers of the tulips and
hyacinths have faded, the Dutch people
dig up the bulbs from which grow the
stems of the plants.</p>

<p>The Dutch people are very proud
of their fine tulips.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>They pack the bulbs carefully.
They sell them and
make a great deal of money.</p>

<p>Bram’s father sails his barge
on the canals to the tulip fields.
Then Bram and Jan and Katrina
and Kassie and Hilda
and Karl help dig up the tulip
bulbs. They put them in boxes
on the barge.</p>

<p>They work busily all the long
day.</p>

<p>“I wonder who will plant
these bulbs?” asked Bram.</p>

<p>“Perhaps some boy in America,”
answered Karl;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> “every year we send
thousands of bulbs to America. The
Americans love our Dutch tulips.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_066.jpg" alt="i_066.jpg" width="403" height="400" />
</div>

<p>When the sun is setting, they sail
back in the big barge. Past the green
meadows they sail, past the yellow
and blue farmhouses with red tiled roofs.</p>

<p>They glide slowly along. The big
barge makes pretty ripples in the smooth
water.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>They see the black and white cows
waiting to be milked. They hear the
cowbells tinkle. They see the Dutch
boys and girls carrying water in big
pails.</p>

<p>They sail past the big, brown windmill.
They see its arms go slowly
round. It makes pretty shadows on
the water in the canal.</p>

<p>They see the willow trees bending
down to look in the water. And they
hear the little birds singing their goodnight
songs.</p>

<p>The sun sinks down, down. The sky
is all red and yellow and orange. The
purple shadows begin to fall. Night is
coming&mdash;and here they are at home
again!</p>

<h3>BRAM’S LITTLE SISTER</h3>

<p>Bram has a little sister. She is a
dear little baby. She has round red
cheeks. She has curly yellow hair.
She has big blue eyes. Her name is
Annetka.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Annetka has a cradle. It is
made of carved wood. It is a very old
cradle.</p>

<p>Little Annetka’s grandfather was
rocked in that very same cradle when
he was a baby. So you can see that it
is very old.</p>

<p>Bram loves his little sister. He likes
to rock her in the quaint, old cradle.</p>

<p>Sometimes he sings to her. He sings
her the song his mother sings.</p>

<p>This is the one he likes best.</p>

<h3>LITTLE RIKKA</h3>
</div>


<p>Rikka is one of Katrina’s little Dutch
friends. She lives near grandmother’s
house by the sea.</p>

<p>Her father is a fisherman. He works
on the fishing-boat with Jan’s father.</p>

<p>Sometimes the fathers take the children
out on the ocean in the big fishing-boats.
The big green waves rock
the boat up and down.</p>

<p>Rikka and Katrina like to sit in the
front end of the boat. They like to
feel on their faces the salt spray from
the ocean.</p>

<p>Jan helps the men with the nets.
He thinks he is like a man when he
works with them. Rikka’s father says
that Jan is a good worker.</p>

<h3>RIKKA’S WONDER-BALL</h3>
</div>


<p>Rikka did not want to learn to knit.
She said it was too hard. She said she
would rather play on the beach.</p>

<p>Her mother said to her, “Rikka, if
you will learn to knit, I will give you a
‘Wonder-Ball.’”</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_074a.jpg" alt="i_074a.jpg" width="380" height="230" />
</div>

<p>“A ‘Wonder-Ball!’ What is that,
mother?” asked Rikka.</p>

<p>“It is a ball of yarn,” said her mother.
“There are little presents or surprise
gifts wound up in the ball. As you
knit the yarn from the ball, the gifts
fall out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should like a Wonder-Ball,
Mother,” cried Rikka.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> “I will learn to
knit and I will knit fast so that I can
knit my presents from the ball.”</p>

<p>Rikka’s mother made her a “Wonder-Ball.”
It was a very big, blue ball.
She gave Rikka some
shining needles and
taught her how
to knit.</p>

<p>Rikka
tried and
tried, and at last she learned to knit.
It was very hard at first, but she did
not give up.</p>

<p>The first gift she knit from her ball
was a little silver pencil. She was
much pleased with it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_074.jpg" alt="i_074.jpg" width="450" height="110" />
</div>

<p>She knit hard
every day.</p>

<p>It seemed a long time before she
came to the next gift.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Then a pretty chain of red beads came
out of the “Wonder-Ball.”</p>

<p>She knit and knit away. The gifts
she knit from the “Wonder-Ball” were
many.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_075.jpg" alt="i_075.jpg" width="436" height="150" />
</div>

<p>She sang a little song as she worked.</p>

<p>She called it her “Knitting Song.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Click, clack, click, clack,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<p>Among her gifts was a little gold ring
with a blue stone in it. She had also
a wooden bird, a tiny
doll, and a thimble.
She called her thimble
her “finger-hat.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_076.jpg" alt="i_076.jpg" width="165" height="300" />
</div>

<p>Rikka was very
happy. She thanked
her good mother many
times for the lovely,
big “Wonder-Ball.”</p>

<p>Rikka soon learned to
knit very well. She liked
to knit even when she had no “Wonder-Ball.”
She knit a scarf for her father.
She knit a jacket for her doll. “It is
such fun to make things,” said busy
little Rikka.</p>

<h3>THE FIRE AND WATER MAN</h3>
</div>


<p>Jan and Katrina were down at
Bram’s house. Bram’s house is by the
canal.</p>

<p>Down the canal came a man in a
boat. Now and then the man would
call “Fire” in a loud voice. Then he
would call “Water.”</p>

<p>He was the Fire-and-Water Man.
He sells fire and water to the people
by the canal.</p>

<p>Bram’s mother called,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> “Quick, Bram!
Here comes the Fire-and-Water Man!
Run for the shovel and buy some coals
of fire from him. I need water, too.
Take the big blue pail with the cover,
then you will not spill any of the water.
Hurry, Bram!”</p>

<p>“I will take your pail to the man,”
said Jan. “I will carry the water and
Bram can carry the fire.”</p>

<p>So Bram and Jan ran down to the
boat and bought hot coals and fresh
water from the man.</p>

<p>Then the man sailed on down the
canal in his boat. They could hear
him calling “Fire” and “Water.” He
was going to sell fire and water to
other Dutch mothers.</p>

<h3>THE WINDMILL GAME</h3>

<p>Jan and Katrina like to play the
Windmill Game. They get Bram and
Hilda and Kassie and Karl to play
with them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<p>This is the way they play the game.
Each one chooses a partner. They
stand back to back. They stretch out
their arms. They wave their arms up
and down. When one arm goes up
the other arm goes down. They look
like a windmill whirling around.</p>

<p>They sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Windmill, windmill, whirl around</div>

      <div class="verse">Away we go,</div>
      <div class="verse">Windmills go both fast and slow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It takes two children to make a
windmill in this Windmill Game. If
Jan and Hilda and Kassie and Karl
and Bram and Katrina all play, how
many windmills do they make?</p>

<h3>THE STORY IN JAN’S BOOK</h3>
</div>


<p>Do you remember the book that
Jan’s mother gave him for his birthday?</p>

<p>Jan has read the book now. He will
tell you the story of little Peter. He
likes it the best of all the stories in his
book.</p>


<h3>THE STORY</h3>

<p>Peter was a little Dutch boy. He
lived in Holland. He lived by the big
dike. The dike was very big and very
strong. It kept the sea from the land
of Holland.</p>

<p>Peter knew how men watched the
dikes. He knew that they had to do
it, for if a leak came in the dike, the
water would rush in.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>The dike would break and the water
would cover the land.</p>

<p>One day Peter’s mother said to Peter,
“Peter, I wish you would take your
father’s dinner to him. He is working
far, far down on the shore. You may
run along on the dike if you wish.”</p>

<p>So Peter started out with his basket.
He went along the dike. He had gone
quite far, and was tired, so he sat
down to rest.</p>

<p>As he sat there, he heard a trickling
sound. “That sounds like water trickling
in a hole,” said Peter to himself.</p>

<p>He looked around. At last he found
a little hole in the dike. The water
was trickling in.</p>

<p>It was only a tiny stream.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>“O, what shall I do?” said Peter.
He ran to see if there was any one
coming. But he could see no one. So
he ran back to the hole in the dike
and put his little hand over the hole.
His hand stopped the water from coming
in.</p>

<p>Poor Peter called and called, but no
one heard. He became very stiff and
lame, but he did not take his hand
from the hole in the dike.</p>

<p>At last the sun went down, and it
began to grow dark. Peter’s father
and mother came to look for him. They
found him cold and frightened with his
little hand over the leak in the dike.</p>

<p>Men came with their tools and
mended the dike.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>“Brave, brave Peter,” they said.
“You have saved your country from a
great flood.”</p>

<p>All the people thought Peter was
very brave indeed. They came to see
him and brought him gifts. Even the
king thanked Peter and sent him a bag
of gold.</p>

<p>“I think Peter was very brave and
very unselfish,” said Jan. “He did
not think of himself, though he was
cold and stiff and frightened. He
thought of all the people who would
lose their homes and lives, and so,
though he was only a little boy, he
was brave and strong enough to save
his country from the sea.”</p>

<h3>A SLEIGH RIDE ON THE CANAL</h3>
</div>


<p>One cold afternoon in winter, Jan’s
mother said, “You may hitch Rink to
the big sled, Jan, and you and Katrina
may ride away down the canal to
grandmother’s house. Grandmother
knows you are coming.”</p>

<p>“You are to stay all night. Father and
I are going to the festival in the city.”</p>

<p>“Oh, good, good!” cried Jan, and
he ran out to tell Katrina.</p>

<p>Katrina was very happy, for she liked
nothing better than to go to grandmother’s
house.</p>

<p>She clapped her hands. “I will get
ready at once,” she cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> “What a
good time we will have with grandmother!”</p>

<p>Jan hitched Rink to the big red
sled. Rink seemed to know he was
going to grandmother’s, for he barked
and wagged his tail for joy.</p>

<p>Then Jan and Katrina got ready for
their long ride on the canal. Jan put
on three coats and a warm muffler.
He wore two caps on his head. Katrina
put on two coats and a shawl,
and wore two hoods.</p>

<p>Their mother tucked them up warmly
on the big sled. She gave them a basket
full of goodies to take to grandmother.
She stood in the door of their little blue
house and waved her hand. “Good-by,
my little ones, good-by,” she called,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
“grandmother will be watching for
you.”</p>

<p>With a bound, Rink was off, and
away they went over the smooth ice
on the canal. They went by the brown
windmill. They saw Hilda, Karl, and
Kassie playing in the snow. Hilda,
Karl, and Kassie shouted at them and
waved their hands. Jan and Katrina
waved back to their friends, and Rink
ran on and on.</p>

<h3>GRANDMOTHER’S STORY</h3>
</div>


<p>It was night. Jan and Katrina and
grandmother had had their supper.
Katrina had helped grandmother wash
the dishes. It was not time for bed.</p>

<p>“Let us sit down before the fire,
Grandmother,” said Jan, “and you can
tell us a story.”</p>

<p>“O yes, please, Grandmother,” cried
little Katrina, and she ran to get grandmother’s
big armchair with the red
cushions.</p>

<p>Grandmother smiled and sat down in
the chair. It had big, wide arms. Jan
sat on one arm of the chair and Katrina
sat on the other.</p>

<p>“What shall I tell you about?”
asked grandmother.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_091.jpg" alt="i_091.jpg" width="312" height="450" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<p>“Tell us about St. Nicholas,” said
Jan. “You know, Grandmother, it is
nearly time for him to come.”</p>

<p>“Why, so it is,” said grandmother.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_092.jpg" alt="i_092.jpg" width="400" height="428" />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she began:</p>

<p>“Far, far away from here, in the forest
of Christmas trees, lives an old man.
He has white
hair, a long
white
beard
and the
brightest
eyes
you ever saw.
He wears a
beautiful red
suit, and it is
trimmed with the whitest of fur. The
name of this good old man is St.
Nicholas. All the year long, in his
forest of Christmas trees, St. Nicholas is
busy making toys and sweetmeats for
the good little boys and girls.”</p>

<p>“What toys does he make, Grandmother?”
asked Katrina.</p>

<p>“O, little wooden dogs and horses
and birds and pigs and chickens and
dolls and doll-houses,” answered grandmother.</p>

<p>Then she went on with her story.
“St. Nicholas has a beautiful big white
horse.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_094.jpg" alt="i_094.jpg" width="198" height="300" />
</div>
<p>“At Christmas time he takes the white
horse from its stall. ‘Come, my horse,’
says St. Nicholas. ‘It is Christmas
time once again, and you must take me
all over the land to visit the little Dutch
boys and girls.’ Then St. Nicholas
calls his black servant. He lets him
ride on a black horse and gives him
two bags to carry. One bag
is full of toys and goodies for
the good children, and in the
other bag is a switch with
which to beat the bad
children. All
through the
night St. Nicholas
rides on
his white horse.”</p>

<p>“The little
Dutch children
put their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>wooden shoes down by the fireplace.
Near by, they put a basket of hay and
carrots for the white horse of St.
Nicholas.</p>

<p>“In the morning, when the good
children get up, the hay and the carrots
are gone, and the wooden shoes are full
of toys and goodies.”</p>

<p>“What a nice story,” says Katrina.</p>

<h3>CHRISTMAS IN HOLLAND</h3>
</div>


<p>It is Christmas Eve. Jan and Katrina
have taken off their wooden shoes.
They have scrubbed them white as
snow, and they have set them down
by the fireplace.</p>

<p>“We must not forget the white
horse,” says Jan.</p>

<p>So, near by, they have placed a
pretty red and yellow basket. In it
are some carrots, some hay, and some
oats. They are for the white horse of
St. Nicholas.</p>

<p>Mother tucks the children in their
funny Dutch beds in the wall.</p>

<p>They look very snug and warm.
Their round cheeks are very red and
their eyes are very bright.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<p>“I hope St. Nicholas will not leave
me a switch, Mother,” says Jan.</p>

<p>“O, I hope not,” says Katrina. “You
do not think he will, do you, Mother?”</p>

<p>Mother smiles and shakes her head:
“I cannot tell, my little ones,” she says.
“Go to sleep now, and in the morning
we shall see.”</p>

<p>So Jan and Katrina turn their faces
to the wall. They cuddle up in their
warm feather beds and go to sleep.</p>



<div class="chapter">

<h3>CHRISTMAS MORNING</h3>
</div>


<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_099.jpg" alt="i_099.jpg" width="203" height="200" />
</div>
<p>Jan and Katrina got up early on
Christmas morning. They ran to the
fireplace. There were the wooden
shoes!
They were
filled with
good things.
There were
toys on the
floor beside
the shoes.</p>

<p>“O Mother! Father! Come quick!
See what the good St. Nicholas has
brought us!” cried Jan and Katrina.</p>

<p>“What beautiful gifts!” says mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
“St. Nicholas must think you are good
children.”</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" alt="i_100.jpg" width="86" height="200" />
</div>

<p>St. Nicholas
brought Jan
a little wooden
horse on
wheels.</p>

<p>He brought
him a woolly
lamb that says
“Baa” when
you press a
spring in its
back.</p>

<p>Jan had three
books, too,
and a pen
and a red pen-holder.
What
fine gifts!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="i_101.jpg" width="296" height="250" />
</div>

<p>Katrina had a little cradle for her
doll. She had a doll-cart. She had a
gold chain, a lace collar, and a pretty
blue gown.</p>

<p>Jan and Katrina also had many
sweetmeats, nuts, and little cakes.</p>

<h3>BRAM’S RABBITS</h3>
</div>


<p>Bram’s father gave him some rabbits.
They are white rabbits, with pink eyes.
They have long, pink ears. They are
very pretty. They like to eat clover
and cabbage and lettuce.</p>

<p>Katrina and Jan like to go to Bram’s
house. When they go there, Jan says,
“Let us go out and see the rabbits,
Bram.” And Bram says, “All right.
Come on, Katrina.” But Katrina wants
to stay and play with baby Annetka.</p>

<p>“You go on, boys,” says she. “I will
come by and by.”</p>

<p>So the boys go out to see the rabbits.
Katrina plays with little Annetka. She
throws a big ball to the baby. The
baby tries to catch it, but she cannot.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<p>Katrina puts Annetka in her little
cart. She rides her up and down on
the brick path in the garden. The
baby likes to see the pretty flowers.
She likes to look at the white shells
and stones by the garden path.</p>

<p>By and by Annetka’s mother comes
out. “It is time for your nap, baby,”
says she. So she takes little Annetka
into the house.</p>

<p>Then Katrina runs away to see the
rabbits.</p>

<h3>THE MARKET</h3>
</div>


<p>One day Katrina and Jan went to
market with Bram and his father.
They sailed down the canal on the
barge.</p>

<p>The market place was full of noise
and busy life.</p>

<p>There were hens and ducks and
geese that cackled and quacked and
hissed.</p>

<p>There were rows and rows of cheeses,
pats of yellow butter, and honeycombs
dripping with honey.</p>

<p>There were dog-carts filled with
milk-cans, with apples, with potatoes,
and other vegetables.</p>

<p>There were Dutch girls selling lace
and flowers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>There were bakers with trays full of
bread, rolls, and cakes.</p>

<p>Katrina bought a wooden spoon to
take home to her mother. Jan bought
mother a big yellow bowl.</p>

<p>“Mother will like to stir cake in it,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, and she can stir it with this
nice, wooden spoon,” said little Katrina.</p>

<h3>WINTER</h3>
</div>


<p>It is winter. The canals in Holland
are frozen over. The ice is very smooth
and thick.</p>

<p>All the Dutch children have skates.
Their fathers and mothers have skates,
too. Everybody that is strong and well
skates on the Dutch canals in Winter.</p>

<p>Jan and Katrina and their little
friends Bram and Hilda and Kassie and
Karl all have skates. They skate up
and down and around and around.</p>

<p>They have skating matches. The
one who can skate farthest and fastest
beats. Sometimes Jan beats and sometimes
Karl does.</p>

<p>The girls cannot skate as fast as the
boys.</p>

<h3>KIND HEARTED JAN</h3>
</div>


<p>One day Jan was down on the beach.
There he saw a man with a dog and a
cart. The man was putting sand in the
cart. He was going to make the dog
pull it into town.</p>

<p>The poor dog was sick. His feet
were sore and he was not strong
enough to pull the heavy cart.</p>

<p>The man had a whip. He whipped
the poor dog. The dog moaned and
cried. He fell down between the shafts
of the cart. His master beat him, and
tried to make him get up.</p>

<p>Jan saw the cruel master whip the
poor dog. He felt very sorry for the
dog. He ran up to the man. “You
must not beat your dog,” said Jan.
“He is old and he is not strong enough
to pull your heavy load.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is a good-for-nothing dog,” said
the man. “I wish I could sell him.”</p>

<p>So Jan asked the man how much he
wanted for the dog. Jan had enough
money, so he bought the poor old dog.</p>

<p>He took him home. He washed the
dog’s sore feet. He gave him food and
drink. He made a soft bed for him to
lie on.</p>

<p>“He will be a playmate for Rink,”
said Jan. “I will call him Kris.”
Kris grew well and strong. He was
always grateful to Jan for saving him
from his cruel master.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
